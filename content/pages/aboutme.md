I'm currently working at [24/7 Software](https://www.247software.com/) as Team Lead.

I completed Computer Engineering in 2014 from Pune, India and joined 24/7 Software in 2014. I got 7+ years of experience in software development and helped teams build enterprise SaaS based web platform from ground up and scaling it.

I helped folks to set the best practices, scalable solutions, patterns/anti-patterns and delivering high-quality work.

I started this blog back in 2015 as a new habit. Writing & note making is a long nourished habit of mine developed during my engineering degree.

This blog and whatever I may write in the future, are nothing but extensions of my notes/thinking/learnings. I do not even expect **anyone** to read blog posts (as it is not promoted anywhere 😂). Having said that, I’m glad to have you as a companion!

As I learn, I write . . . as I write, I learn.

I believe in "Learn In Public" method. Worth Reading &mdash;

I'm well versed in all web standards, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, AWS Services, Laravel and leaning towards the programming aspects of web development.
