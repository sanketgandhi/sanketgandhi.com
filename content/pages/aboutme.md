I'm currently working at [24/7 Software](https://www.247software.com/) as Team Lead.

I completed Computer Engineering degree in 2014 from Pune, India and started working in IT company. I got +7 years of experience in Software Development and helped teams build enterprise SaaS web platform from ground up.

I helped people to set the best practices, scalable solution, patterns and delivering high-quality work.

I started this blog in 2015 as a place to document everything I learned, experiencing while building products. I believe in "Learn In Public" method. Worth Reading &mdash;

I'm well versed in all web standards, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, AWS Services, Laravel and leaning towards the programming aspects of web development.
