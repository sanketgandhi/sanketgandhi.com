Iâ€™m Sanket Gandhi. I'm currently leading a team at [24/7 Software](https://www.247software.com/). I joined the team in Sept 2014 as a entry-level junior software developer straight out of college and grew to eventually become team leader.

I started this blog as a place to document everything I learned. Learn in public -
