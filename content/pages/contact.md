I'm currently leading a team at [24/7 Software](https://www.247software.com/). I joined the team in Sept 2014 as a entry-level junior software developer straight out of college and grew to eventually become team leader.

I attended [Pune University](http://unipune.ac.in/) and received B.E. in Computer Science. My main focus is in building web application.
