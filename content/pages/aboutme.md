I'm currently working at [24/7 Software](https://www.247software.com/) as a Principal Software Engineer.

I completed my computer engineering in 2014 in Pune, India, and joined 24/7 Software in 2014. I have 8+ years of experience in software development and have helped teams build enterprise SaaS-based web platforms from the ground up and scale them.

I helped folks to set best practices, scalable solutions, patterns and anti-patterns and deliver high-quality work.

I started this blog back in 2015 as a new habit. Writing & note making is a long nourished habit of mine, developed during my engineering degree.

This blog and whatever I may write in the future are nothing but extensions of my notes/thinking/learning. I do not expect anyone to read my blog posts (as they are not promoted anywhere though! 😂). Having said that, I’m glad to have you as a companion!

As I learn, I write... as I write, I learn. I believe in the "Learn In Public" method. Worth Reading &mdash;
